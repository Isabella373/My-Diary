- I like keeping dairy. It is a fantastic way to express all the frustrated feeling and release my pressure.
- Nowadays, people record and share their life through social media, but sometimes what we share is not always our real life and real feeling. Diary can create a secret space for your own.
- I always found that my money in the bank secretly disappear in a fantastic speed. Diary can help you record when and how you spend money.
